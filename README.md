## üìä Data Files

The repository maintains six regularly updated data files:

1. `tunnelbear_ips.json` - A JSON array containing only the unique exit IP addresses used by TunnelBear servers. This is a simplified version of the data focusing only on the IP addresses.

2. `tunnelbear_ips.txt` - A plain text file with one IP address per line, making it easy to use in scripts or other tools that expect a simple list format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Checking if an IP address is a TunnelBear IP

#### Python Example - Check Exit IP

```python
import json
import netaddr

def is_tunnelbear_exit_ip(ip_to_check, json_path='tunnelbear_ips.json'):
    """Check if an IP address is a TunnelBear exit IP"""
    try:
        # Validate IP address format
        netaddr.IPAddress(ip_to_check)
        
        # Load the TunnelBear IPs list
        with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
            tunnelbear_ips = json.load(f)
            
        # Check if IP is in the list
        return ip_to_check in tunnelbear_ips
    except netaddr.AddrFormatError:
        print(f"Error: {ip_to_check} is not a valid IP address")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return False

# Usage example
ip = "123.45.67.89"  # Example IP address
if is_tunnelbear_exit_ip(ip):
    print(f"{ip} is a TunnelBear exit IP")
else:
    print(f"{ip} is not a TunnelBear exit IP")
```
